# Smart Vision Builder

This repository contains a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend starter configured with Tailwind CSS and several UI libraries.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies (choose one package manager):
   - Using npm (recommended):
     ```sh
     npm ci
     npm run dev
     ```
   - If you prefer bun, remove `package-lock.json` and use bun commands. This project currently tracks `package-lock.json` so using npm is the simpler option.

2. Build for production:
   ```sh
   npm run build
